# AltDSS-Python: modern Python bindings for an alternative implementation of EPRI's OpenDSS

**To be updated.**

This is a new package that provides a modern Python approach. It is unique among all other interfaces for OpenDSS in that it exposes details of the DSS objects, buses, and more, wrapping all methods in more Python-native objects.
