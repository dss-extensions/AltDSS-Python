# 0.10.5

Released on 2020-03-03. This is a maintenance release.

- Updated to DSS C-API 0.10.5, which includes most changes up to OpenDSS v8.6.7.1. Includes new properties and new experimental components (under testing).
- New properties exposed: `ActiveClass.ActiveClassParent`, `PVSystems.Pmpp`, `PVSystems.IrradianceNow`.
- For the time being, `dss.v8` doesn't use the parallel-machine version anymore. This will be addressed in a future release, most likely in the 0.11.x series coming in the following months.

DSS C-API 0.10.5 changes:

- Disable builds and distribution of v8-only variation -- the extra/missing parallel-machine will be completely merged in a mixed (v7+v8) codebase in the coming months.
- This version should be fully API compatible with 0.10.3+.
- `Bus` and `CktElement` API functions reworked with some more checks.
- Updated up to revision 2837 of the official OpenDSS code:
    - Ported changes from SVN (v7 and v8) into DSS C-API v7 variation (v8 was left untouched).
    - 4 new API level functions (`ActiveClass_Get_ActiveClassParent`, `PVSystems_Get_Pmpp`, `PVSystems_Set_Pmpp`, `PVSystems_Get_IrradianceNow`)
    - 4 new components: `PVsystem2`, `Storage2`, `InvControl2`, `StorageController2` -- *added for early testing, no dedicated API functions yet*. At the moment, please consider them experimental features subject to change.
    - `CIM100`: several changes
    - `ExpControl`: new `Tresponse` property
    - `ConductorData`, `LineConstants`, `LineGeometry`: new `Capradius` property
    - `XfmrCode`, `Transformer`: new Seasons and Ratings properties
    - `Bus_Get_puVLL` and `Bus_Get_VLL` -- see revision 2836 (official SVN). Included an extra fix in DSS C-API to avoid some corner cases.
    - Other small bug fixes like the Full Carson fix -- see https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/discussion/861976/thread/2de01d0cdb/ and revision 2805 (official SVN)

# 0.10.4

Released on 2019-11-16. This is a maintenance release.

- Updated to DSS C-API 0.10.4.
- Fix `dss.enums.YMatrixModes`
- Make `DSS.ActiveCircuit.CktElements` iterable (e.g. `for element in DSS.ActiveCircuit.CktElements: ...`);


DSS C-API 0.10.4 changes include:

- Updated up to revision 2761 of the official OpenDSS code. The changes affect at least the following components: CIMXML export, `Capacitor`, `InvControl`, `LineGeometry`, `PVsystem`, `StorageController`, `Storage`, `Vsource`, `VCCS`.
- This version should be fully compatible with 0.10.3.
- Fixes issue with long paths on Linux, potentially other platforms too.


# 0.10.3

Released on 2019-05-22. This is the last release to provide pre-built binaries for Python 3.4.

- Includes fix for issue with the line parameters on Linux and macOS due to memory-address aliasing issues.
- Prebuilt binaries for DSS C-API and KLUSolve are used instead of rebuilding everything from source.
- Prebuilt packages (wheels) for 32-bit Linux are now available.
- Development artifacts are now included in the distribution package. This enables advanced usage and easier integration with compiled languages (examples pending, please open an issue if you'd like to know more).
- `ReduceCkt` ported from COM: new circuit reduction methods available in `DSS.ActiveCircuit.ReduceCkt`
- `Lines`: ported from COM, new seasonal ratings mechanism that allows changing the current rating through the simulation
- Optimization and extended error-checking in many properties
- Includes new `Settings.LoadsTerminalCheck`: on static scenarios (no open terminals for loads) to toggle the costly checks for open terminals. If set to false, it can save around 25% of simulation time, depending on the circuit characteristics.
- All components now can be accessed by index (`idx` property)
- All components now have faster `Name` iteration
- Ported to v7/default interface: the DSS commands `CalcIncMatrix`, `CalcIncMatrix_O`, `Refine_BusLevels`, `CalcLaplacian`, and related export options: `IncMatrix`, `IncMatrixRows`, `IncMatrixCols`, `BusLevels`, `Laplacian`, `ZLL`, `ZCC`, `Contours`, `Y4`. Also includes related Python-level properties.
- Some other new properties:
    - `CktElement.IsIsolated`
    - `Lines.IsSwitch`
    - `Transformers.LossesByType` and `Transformers.AllLossesByType`

# 0.10.2

Released on 2019-02-28.

- `CtrlQueue`: Add the missing function `Push`. See [CtrlQueueTest.py](https://github.com/dss-extensions/electricdss-tst/blob/master/Test/CtrlQueueTest.py) for an example ported from the Excel VBA example.
- New `DSS.AllowEditor`: this new property controls if the external editor is called on DSS commands like `Show`. If set to `False`, the editor is not called, but other side effects should not be affected (e.g. files can be created).
- The `enum34` module was added as a dependency for Python < 3.5.
- The `Options` enumeration was split into several new enumerations (`AutoAddTypes`, `CktModels`, `ControlModes`, `SolutionLoadModels`, `SolutionAlgorithms`, `RandomModes`). It is now marked as deprecated for future removal.
- `LoadShapes` are faster due to [changes from DSS C-API](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_capi/blob/master/docs/changelog.md#version-0102)


# 0.10.1

Released on 2019-02-17.

This is a minor DSS Python release that contains lots of changes from DSS C-API. See also the [changes from DSS C-API](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_capi/blob/ed2a6b322a5e102ba61c6565e5e0eb23247b9221/docs/changelog.md#version-0101) for details, including changes from the official OpenDSS code since 0.10.0.

DSS Python has recently moved from https://github.com/PMeira/dss_python/ to the new https://dss-extensions.org/ and https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_python/

## Major changes:

- More and faster error-checking! Python exception will be raised for more errors and with a lower overhead.
- Fix for `YMatrix.getI` and `YMatrix.getV` (ported from OpenDSSDirect.py)
- Fix for `ActiveCircuit.ActiveCktElement.Variable` and `ActiveCircuit.ActiveCktElement.Variablei`: now returns a tuple of `(value, errorcode)`, compatible with COM.
- New `DSS.Error.EarlyAbort`: controls whether all errors halts the DSS script processing (Compile/Redirect), defaults to True.

# 0.10.0

Released on 2018-11-17.

## Major changes:
- The creation of the binary modules has been automated using Travis-CI and AppVeyor. We expect that this will allow us to release more often, bringing new features sooner.
- Integrates many fixes from the upstream OpenDSS and changes specific to DSS C-API.
- Reorganizes and reuses the code across DSS versions (v7 and v8) 
- Uses `__slots__` to simplify attribute handling.
- Exposes both the our classic API (e.g. `dss.v7.DSS_IR` for the immediate/direct results) and global result API (e.g. `dss.v7.DSS_GR` for the global result interface). See [DSS C-API's docs](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_capi/blob/master/docs/usage.md) for a detailed explanation. We default to the GR interface since it will generally be faster at the cost of a small memory overhead.
- Although still experimental, the v8/PM module is more stable. If you try it, please give feedback.
- Error checking is now done for most API writes. That is, if a an OpenDSS error occurs, it should cause a Python exception soon after. Previously, you need to call `CheckForError()` manually to trigger this. This change was introduced after user reports indicated that manually checking for errors is a common behavior.
- Exposes API extensions for the classes `LineGeometry`, `WireData`, `LineSpacing`, `CNData`, `TSData`, `Reactor`.
- Makes most DSS classes iterable (including buses), e.g. you can now use:
```python
for l in DSS.ActiveCircuit.Loads:
    print(l.Name)
```
- Adds a COM patching function (`dss.patch_dss_com`) -- that is, extend the COM instance with iterators like above and some other few functions to make it easier to exchange between COM and DSS Python:
```python

import win32com.client, dss
com = dss.patch_dss_com(win32com.client.gencache.EnsureDispatch("OpenDSSEngine.DSS"))

# ...compile a circuit, etc.

for l in com.ActiveCircuit.Loads:
    print(l.Name, l.kva)

for b in com.ActiveCircuit.ActiveBus:
    print(b.Name, b.x, b.y)
```

## Performance
On microbenchmarks, the GR interface can reduce the running time up to 50% (typically 25%) on properties that return arrays. If you find issues using the default GR interface, you can always use the classic interface from 0.9.8 by importing the appropriate module: `from dss import DSS_IR as DSS`. Currently, the GR changes do not affect writing data (setting properties), only reading them.

## Mixed-cased handling
If you were using `use_com_compat` to allow mixed-cased attributes, it should work better than before. You may now use `use_com_compat(warn=True)` to warn when you use an attribute that wouldn't exist without calling `use_com_compat`. The intention is that the user should run their code to get a list of warnings, fix it, and then remove `use_com_compat` since it does have a small performance impact.
